Here's a **detailed implementation plan** to build a **Mutual TLS (mTLS) Proof of Concept** using a basic server and a few clients, where both **server and clients authenticate each other via certificates**.

---

## 🔐 Objective of the PoC

Demonstrate how **Mutual TLS** (also known as **two-way SSL**) works by:

* Creating a **Certificate Authority (CA)**
* Generating and signing **server and client certificates**
* Running a **secure server (e.g., using Node.js, Java, Python, or Go)**
* Connecting **sample clients**, configured with client certificates
* Validating **client authentication** at the server side

## 📦 Tech Stack Suggestion

You can implement this in any language, but here’s a minimal example stack:

| Component            | Choice                                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Certificate Creation | `OpenSSL`                                                |
| Server               | Node.js (HTTPS server) / Python Flask / Java Spring Boot |
| Clients              | Curl / Python `requests` / Postman with certs            |

> We’ll use **Node.js** for the HTTPS server and **curl** / Python `requests` as clients for this PoC. Let me know if you'd prefer Java, Go, or Spring Boot instead.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Setup the Certificate Authority (CA)

```bash
mkdir mtls-demo && cd mtls-demo
mkdir certs && cd certs

# Create CA key
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

# Create CA cert
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca.crt \
-subj "/C=IN/ST=KA/L=Bangalore/O=DemoCA/CN=DemoRootCA"
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create Server Certificate (signed by CA)

```bash
# Generate server private key
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

# Generate CSR
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr \
-subj "/C=IN/ST=KA/L=Bangalore/O=ServerOrg/CN=localhost"

# Sign the server certificate using CA
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
-CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Create Client Certificates (signed by CA)

You can create multiple clients (client1, client2, etc.):

```bash
# Client 1
openssl genrsa -out client1.key 2048
openssl req -new -key client1.key -out client1.csr \
-subj "/C=IN/ST=KA/L=Bangalore/O=ClientOrg/CN=client1"
openssl x509 -req -in client1.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
-CAcreateserial -out client1.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

Repeat for client2 by changing `client2` in key/csr/crt file names.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Implement HTTPS Server (Node.js Example with mTLS)

```javascript
// server.js
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('certs/server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('certs/server.crt'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync('certs/ca.crt'),
  requestCert: true,
  rejectUnauthorized: true,
};

const server = https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  const cert = req.socket.getPeerCertificate();
  if (req.client.authorized) {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Hello, ${cert.subject.CN}! Client verified ✅\n`);
  } else {
    res.writeHead(401);
    res.end('❌ Client authentication failed.\n');
  }
});

server.listen(8443, () => {
  console.log('🚀 mTLS server listening on https://localhost:8443');
});
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Test with Clients

#### 🧪 Test using Curl (Client 1)

```bash
curl --cert certs/client1.crt --key certs/client1.key --cacert certs/ca.crt https://localhost:8443
```

You should see:

```text
Hello, client1! Client verified ✅
```

#### 🚫 Test without Client Certificate

```bash
curl --cacert certs/ca.crt https://localhost:8443
```

You should see:

```text
❌ Client authentication failed.
```

#### ✅ Test with Python Client (Optional)

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://localhost:8443',
    cert=('certs/client1.crt', 'certs/client1.key'),
    verify='certs/ca.crt'
)

print(response.text)
```

## ✅ Summary of Files Structure

```
mtls-demo/
├── certs/
│   ├── ca.crt, ca.key
│   ├── server.key, server.csr, server.crt
│   ├── client1.key, client1.csr, client1.crt
│   └── client2.key, client2.csr, client2.crt
└── server.js
```

## 📈 Bonus: Extend the PoC

* ✅ Add multiple endpoints to simulate protected resources.
* ✅ Add logging for certificate details (issuer, CN, expiry).
* 🔐 Simulate expired/revoked certs and rejection.
* 🔧 Replace localhost with domain (e.g., using `/etc/hosts`).
* 📦 Convert to Docker setup for isolated testing.
